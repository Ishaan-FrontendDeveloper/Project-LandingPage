        <div class="intro">Cārvāka (pronounced as Charvaka), was one of the most popular Darśana or school of thought in Ancient India, it goes back at least to 600BC, where a philosopher known as Brihaspati is considered its founder.One of its' core philosophy is, "eat,drink and be merry", which can be considered a far-cry from the renouncing of all worldly pleasures as observed from the other philosophies of that era.</div>
        <div class="major">
            Imagine being a peasant in Ancient India.You work hard all day, you try living your life as honestly as you can. The major religion at the time tells you that desire is the root cause of all pain and suffering in life. Is life even worth living without desire you ask yourself. Charvaka carries with itself the answer to that very question. A Charvaka does not believe in anything that he cannot perceive using his senses or with an extension of his senses. A Charvaka does not believe in heaven, hell or karma. As the rival Jain and Buddhist scholars described a Charvaka as someone that,"would take loans to have a taste of <i>ghee</i>(clarified butter)." To be a Charvaka is to live life joyously even if it means taking loans, for what is life without joy? It was and is considered too short-sighted of a philosophy, considering the fact that it promotes materialism, the sole thing that drove Siddharta Gautama down the path of becoming a Buddha. I say it is practical, even in these modern times when science has progressed as far as it has now. A Charvaka of Ancient India would fit in perfectly, he/she/they would totally understand the fact that atoms exist, because they can be perceived using instruments. As good as it sounds, currently all we know about it is from a few quotes,which have been mentioned here and from scholars of other philosophies. Everything else is lost to time, forever. Charvaka experienced what it preached, it had its moments of joy before its untimely death.
